# DCS-ChaosScriptLoader
# INSTALLATION:
Files inside the 'miz' folder should be embedded in the .miz itself, be it as a do-script or do-script-file.
Files in the 'scripts' folder should be where you have configured your FilePath to be. This folder should have a 'saves' subdirectory. This is user configurable, but I personally prefer to use 'Saved Games/DCS/Missions/scripts/'
